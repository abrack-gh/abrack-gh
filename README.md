<h2> Skills and Languages </h2>

The vast majority of my skill lays with Java and it's associated frameworks, primarily Spring.

<h2> My Coding Journey...</h2>

I first started using computers at a very young age. My dad passed me down his old Acer Laptop with Windows XP. I first found myself fascinated with cybersecurity and online threats, and I would spend hours watching people set up VM's and download all sorts of malware to see how their Anti-Virus suite would respond to them. Fast forward a few years, and my attention turned to developing. 

When I was around 11, I got into simple HTML and CSS. Looking at source code for other websites, I started building my own 'knock-off' websites. I stopped developing for a few years while I went to University. But I soon realised that this is what I loved doing. Fast forward to today, and I've found my real passion... back end and full stack development. 

I took learning Java very seriously, and it is, controversially, my favourite programming language - and the one I've stuck to! I love problem solving - fixing bugs, I love building and I love learning. 

Thank you for checking out my profile, and have a wonderful day! :)
